When behavior changes, agents must update:

- README.md (user-facing behavior)
- docs/ relevant page (architecture/UI/MIDI/presets)
- CHANGELOG.md with clear summary

Documentation audience:

- Maintainer is fluent in Python/SQL but newer to Lua.
- Prefer clarity over Lua cleverness.
- Explain why, not just how.
