description: Lua style rules to keep code readable and safe
globs: ["**/*.lua"]

Style rules:

- Use `local` for everything unless norns requires global.
- Modules must follow:

  local M = {}

  function M.foo()
  end

  return M

- Prefer explicit names over short Lua idioms.
- Avoid metatables unless necessary.
- Avoid clever one-liners; optimize for readability.
- Every file begins with a short comment explaining what/why.
- Public functions must have doc comments.
- Do not leak globals.
