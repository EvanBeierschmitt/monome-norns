description: How agents must behave in this repository
alwaysApply: true
---

This repository is primarily authored by AI agents. Favor safety, minimal changes, and correctness over cleverness.

Rules:

- Never invent norns APIs. Verify against existing repo code or official monome docs.
- Prefer small, incremental patches over refactors.
- Do not refactor architecture unless explicitly asked.
- Leave the repository in a runnable state after every change.
- When a request is ambiguous, implement the narrowest correct interpretation and explain assumptions.
- When adding features, also implement:
  - parameter defaults
  - persistence (if applicable)
  - documentation updates
  - at least one logic test if the change is testable
- If uncertain, ask for clarification rather than guessing.
