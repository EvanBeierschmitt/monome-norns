description: Hard constraints of the norns runtime and UI
globs: ["**/*.lua"]
---

Assume code runs inside the monome norns Lua environment.

Platform constraints:

- Screen is 128x64, grayscale.
- Redraws must be efficient and avoid allocations inside hot paths.
- Avoid creating garbage in timing loops.
- UI must tolerate slow redraw cadence.
- Encoders and keys are primary interaction model.
- Do not assume desktop Lua behavior or external Lua libraries.
- Avoid global variables unless required by norns conventions.

Script metadata:

- Main script file must include a proper header comment block for the SELECT menu.
- Folder names like `lib/`, `docs/`, `data/`, `test/` are special and should not contain entry scripts.
