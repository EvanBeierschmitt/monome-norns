description: Required repository layout and responsibilities
alwaysApply: true

Expected layout:

- main script file at repo root (entry point)
- lib/          reusable Lua modules
- docs/         human documentation
- data/         presets, fixtures, example state
- test/         logic tests (not visible in SELECT)

Architectural rules:

- Entry script wires modules together but contains minimal logic.
- Logic lives in lib/ modules.
- UI, sequencing, state, MIDI/CV, and persistence should be separated into modules.
- Modules use `local M = {}` and `return M` pattern.
- No circular dependencies between modules.
