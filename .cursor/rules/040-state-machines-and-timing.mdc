description: Invariants for sequencing, timing, and state machines
globs: ["**/*.lua"]
---

This project contains sequencers and state machines.

These invariants must be preserved:

- Tick loop must be deterministic.
- No blocking operations inside timing loop.
- Event ordering must remain stable.
- Jump/branch behavior must be explicit and documented.
- State transitions must be pure and testable where possible.
- Persistence format must be versioned if modified.
- Randomization must be seedable if applicable.
